Arrays -> lists, indexed at 0, has elements
Saves outputs as arrays

(Get-Process).GetType() -> gets type of anything, every newline is a part of an array

each line has its own index position


$proc = get-process, $proc[0], will get the first index, [-1] for the last one
 $procs -is [array]: true
 $var -is [array]: false
 
 to find the amount of items in an array
 
 $proc.Count
 $proc.length

create an array 

  $array = 1,5,10
  $array = 1..25


polymorphic arrays
  
can store multiple data types in polymorphic arrays

$array2 = "world". "hello", 5, 10, (Get-Date)

($array[-1]).gettype() -> system.valuetype

out of index does not get any errors for polymorphic arrays

create an empty array
  $array3=@()
  
$array[$array.Count-1]

(-4..10)[4] gets a number in range -4 to 10 so gets -3

can display multiple indexes of the array at once

$array[4,0,1,2] -> in the order specified
